# **App Name**: CanvasFlow

## Core Features:

- Content Ingestion: Import content via URL or local files (mp4, jpg, mp3, png, glb, gltf, obj) using drag-and-drop, copy-paste, or list uploads. Save assets to a personal cloud library.
- Versatile Canvas: Offers a free-form canvas area where users can place and manipulate web players (video, music, animations, interactive elements, files, maps, websites) and website snippets/iframes.
- Layout Options: Display ingested files in pre-defined grids, customizable grids, or as freeform arrangements on the canvas. The initial setup will feature a 5x5 grid arrangement of players.
- Player Controls: Individual and group controls to manipulate players, including scaling (with a slider ranging from 1x1 to 10x10 for grid mode), placement, and embedding of iframes/HTML.
- 3D Canvas Mode: Transform 2D canvas elements into a 3D environment. Manipulate, position, and project 2D elements onto 3D surfaces; offers 3D environment editing tools.
- Aesthetic Frame Tool: Add aesthetic and functional frames to players individually or in groups. Frames can operate in both 2D and 3D environments.
- Animation Engine: Overlay the canvas with interactive 2D and 3D animations, operating independently, within grid areas, or linked to individual players.
- Content Adaptive Styling: Employ an AI tool that will automatically analyze the current context and other apps/websites of similar content in order to propose the user an ideal framing scheme for the application's players.
- Shareable Exports: Share content lists and arrangements via internally generated links and in-app messaging. Develop custom iframe and HTML export functionality.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to reflect the vastness of a limitless canvas.
- Background color: Very light indigo (#E8EAF6) for a clean and unobtrusive workspace.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#7E57C2), a hue approximately 30 degrees to the left of indigo on the color wheel, to provide high contrast for focus elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern and neutral look, ensuring legibility across all canvas modes.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for code snippets.
- Simple and modern icons, dynamically colored to match the active tool or mode.
- Adaptable layout system, fluidly adjusting between grid, freeform, and 3D modes while maintaining usability.
- Subtle transitions between tools and canvas modes, with interactive animations that react to content and user input.
